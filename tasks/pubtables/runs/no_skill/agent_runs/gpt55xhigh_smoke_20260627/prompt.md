## Task

Given a local PubTables-style OCR word JSON file, reconstruct the table structure, normalize the metric rows, audit the extracted values, and write a short grounded Markdown summary.

The input JSON follows the PubTables-style word-box setup: it contains a table bounding box and page words with text plus bounding boxes. Some caption and footnote words are present outside the table bounding box. Use word positions to reconstruct rows, columns, header cells, row spans, and column spans. Exclude caption and footnote words from the normalized metric rows.

Required normalized metric fields:
- method
- dataset
- accuracy
- f1
- notes

For the audit, report the number of normalized metric rows, the best method by F1 score for each dataset, and any extraction or validation issues you find.

## Available Skill Documents

No external skill document is provided in this condition.

## Condition Note

No skill document is provided. This measures direct model behavior.

## Required Outputs

Save these artifacts:

- `OUTPUT_CELLS_CSV` -> `artifacts/table_cells.csv`: CSV columns row_id,col_id,row_span,col_span,is_header,text for every reconstructed non-empty table cell.
- `OUTPUT_METRICS_CSV` -> `artifacts/metrics.csv`: CSV columns method,dataset,accuracy,f1,notes with one row per metric observation.
- `OUTPUT_AUDIT_JSON` -> `artifacts/audit.json`: JSON with row_count, best_by_dataset, and issues.
- `SUMMARY_MD` -> `artifacts/summary.md`: Short Markdown summary grounded in the extracted metrics and audit.

Do not use GUI operations, screenshots, external APIs, web/network calls, or shell commands.
